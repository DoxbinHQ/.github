 Here at Doxbin, we supply users with the ability to upload text information without the fear of censorship. Most pastes won't come down without a court order. What this means is that if your info goes up, it's not coming down unless it's inaccurate, breaks our TOS or we recieve a court order from our server hosted country.

 Doxbin is a document sharing and publishing website for text-based information. There are no limitations on what info you can post as long as it's not spam, child explicit material or violating hosting country jurisdictional laws. For example, kiddie porn links, your mothers creditcard and any support of terrorism/threats of physical violence is not allowed here.

 Doxbin is not your personal army, nor your personal slam page.
